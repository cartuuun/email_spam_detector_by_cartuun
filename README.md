I have created a machine learning algorithm which can classify e-mail messages into spam or non-spam (ham) category.
Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm was used for the model creation.
Joblib was further used to create pickel (.pkl) file of the model to put it to use in deployment phrase.
Model was deployed on heroku (https://spam-detector-by-cartuuun.herokuapp.com/) and html , css and python scripts were set up.
requirements.txt is given in the repository for creation of the suitable environment.
THIS DEPLOYED MODEL AND WEBSITE IS READY TO USE. (can also work on S.M.S)
